    <h2>Natural Environment</h2>
    <p>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally, meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth. This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources that affect human survival and economic activity. The concept of the natural environment can be distinguished as components:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention, including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within their boundaries and their nature.</li>
    	<li>Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from civilized human actions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. Built environments are where humans have fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human, hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural.<br>People cannot find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum, from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. The massive environmental changes of humanity in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural environments: including from climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other chemicals in the air and water. More precisely, we can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness is not uniform.[2] If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>It is the common understanding of natural environment that underlies environmentalism â€” a broad political, social, and philosophical movement that advocates various actions and policies in the interest of protecting what nature remains in the natural environment, or restoring or expanding the role of nature in this environment. While true wilderness is increasingly rare, wild nature (e.g., unmanaged forests, uncultivated grasslands, wildlife, wildflowers) can be found in many locations previously inhabited by humans.<br>

Goals for the benefit of people and natural systems, commonly expressed by environmental scientists and environmentalists include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Elimination of pollution and toxicants in air, water, soil, buildings, manufactured goods, and food.
</li>
<li>
Preservation of biodiversity and protection of endangered species.
</li>
<li>
Conservation and sustainable use of resources such as water, land, air, energy, raw materials, and natural resources.
</li>
<li>
Halting human-induced global warming, which represents pollution, a threat to biodiversity, and a threat to human populations.
</li>
<li>
Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy in electricity, heating and cooling, and transportation, which addresses pollution, global warming, and sustainability. This may include public transportation and distributed generation, which have benefits for traffic congestion and electric reliability.
</li>
<li>
Shifting from meat-intensive diets to largely plant-based diets in order to help mitigate biodiversity loss and climate change.
</li>
<li>
Establishment of nature reserves for recreational purposes and ecosystem preservation.
</li>
<li>
Sustainable and less polluting waste management including waste reduction (or even zero waste), reuse, recycling, composting, waste-to-energy, and anaerobic digestion of sewage sludge.
</li>
<li>
Reducing profligate consumption and clamping down on illegal fishing and logging.
</li>
<li>
Slowing and stabilisation of human population growth.
</li>
</ul>
